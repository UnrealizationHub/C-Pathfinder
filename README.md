# XGrid C++ Pathfinder Plugin

The XGrid C++ Pathfinder Plugin can be added to your project by following these simple steps.

1. Download the Plugin.zip file that corresponds to your engine version (Click on it on, then in the top right click the 3 dots to download just the zip file)
2. Unzip the file into the first tier directory of your Unreal project (e.g. UnrealProjects/YourProject). If you already have a Plugins folder, unzip elsewhere and place the HybridPathfinderPlugin into your Plugins folder.
3. Open Unreal Engine and go to Edit -> Plugins
4. Search for HybridPathfinderPlugin and enable it if it is not already enable.
5. Reset Unreal Engine

Once the plugin is added to Unreal, you can continue with the next steps in the C++ Pathfinder Plugin installation guide!
